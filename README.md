# Team Work Efforts:

First of all, we created a Slack and zoom group to establish communication between all the team members. 
Then we connected over zoom meet for further discussion about assigned project.

In a zoom meet we divideed small parts of project to all the team-member.

We discussed about past days work and present day work, if any one face issue all the team member helps to solve the problem.

All push the data in Git-hub to their respective branch and merge them to main branch.

Finally we make the presentation of the project.
<br/><br/>

## Our Learnings
On this journey we faced many issues, but we keep motivated each other with patience. 

- We all learned how to read and understand the code of other team members.

- We learned how to write more efficient and clean code.

- Even though  We also learned how to plan a project and how to execute it step by step.

- By this Project we have learned how to collaborate and communicate with team effectively and improving the productivity.

- We also got a glimpse of using GitHub for the version control.
